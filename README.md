# Breast_Cancer

This file contains data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/haithemhermessi/breast-cancer-screening-data-set). This dataset includes data from a random sample of 20,000 digital and 20,000 film-screen mammograms received by women age 60-89 years within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) between January 2005 and December 2008. Some women contribute multiple examinations to the dataset. (Pulled from Context section of data section). 

I used python in the Jupyter notebook environment to clean the data and implement a logistic regression machine learning model. It had an accuracy score of 99.975%. I used cancer diagnosis as the target variable. I think the model performed very well because most of the diagnoses were negative. The data was mainly helpful for learning how to clean large amounts of data.
